    <h1>Indigenous Languages in Treaty 4 and Treaty 6 Territories</h1>
    <p>
        Saskatchewan Polytechnic campuses are located on Treaty 4 & Treaty 6 territories and the homelands of the Métis.
        These territories cover the homelands of several First Nations and the Métis. We respectfully recognize the
        Indigenous peoples of these lands as part of our ongoing commitment to good relations and a reconciled future.
        This web page will briefly examine some of the languages that were used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that there is overlap in the Indigenous peoples that lived in the two treaty areas.
        The original Nations of Saskatchewan include: nêhiyawak* (Plains Cree), Nahkawininiwak (Saulteaux),
        Nakota (Assiniboine), Dakota and Lakota (Sioux), and Denesuline (Dene/Chipewyan). List based on
        <a href="https://teaching.usask.ca/indigenoussk/import/indigenous_peoplesof_saskatchewan.php">Indigenous
            peoples of Saskatchewan</a>, <cite>Indigenous Saskatchewan Encyclopedia</cite>.
    </p>
    <aside>
        *The term for Cree varies according to dialect. Plains Cree are nêhiyawak, Woodland Cree are nêhithawak and
        Swampy Cree are nêhinawak.

    <h2>Current Population Demographics</h2>
    <p>
        The Indigenous population in Saskatchewan is growing. This growth is evident among young people where 46% of
        Indigenous individuals are under age 25, compared to 29% for the rest of the Canadian population. Métis
        self-identification is also contributing to the growing population.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Saskatchewan, Indigenous peoples make up 15.6% of the provincial population.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Saskatchewan, there are 157,740 Indigenous peoples of whom: 62% are Registered Indian, 6% are Non-Status
        Indian, 32% are Métis, 0% are Inuit, and 0% have other Indigenous identities.

    <h1>Treaty Time Line</h1>
    <p>
        Treaties 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 were negotiated in what is now Saskatchewan. They were agreements between the First
        Nations and the British Crown. These treaties are the foundation of Saskatchewan’s history. They established the
        relationship between the newcomers, settlers, and First Nations. These treaty relationships exist today between
        the Government of Canada and the First Nations peoples. These treaties are to last “as long as the sun shines,
        the grass grows, and the rivers flow.”
